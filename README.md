<strong>Overview </strong>

In this project you will create 3 simple, binary 25×25 images or your choice and use Java 2D graphic methods to rotate, scale and translate each of the images.

<strong>Requirements: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Using Netbeans or Eclipse, develop a Java 2D graphics application that creates 3 images. The images should have the following specifications:

  <ol>

   <li>Size: 25×25 pixels</li>

   <li>Type: binary (consists of ones or zeros)</li>

   <li>Simple form or shape (Hint: consider a letter or number, or even simple shapes such as crossing lines, rectangles, or circles</li>

   <li>You should generate the image inside of separate methods and store them as 2D arrays.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Use Java 2D graphics to display your original images.</li>

 <li>For each image use the existing Java 2D graphics transformation methods to translate, rotate and scale each object. You should perform the following transformations on each image:

  <ol>

   <li>Translate -5 in x direction, Translate +7 in the y direction.</li>

   <li>Rotate 45 counter clockwise.</li>

   <li>Rotate 90 clockwise</li>

   <li>Scale 2 times for the x component, scale 0.5 times for the y component</li>

   <li>Each of these transformations should be displayed in sequence with the images always starting from the previous transformation as opposed to the original image.</li>

   <li>Use Java 2D graphics to display each transformation for each image. (Hint: you can do this with loop and slight pause for each display)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>All Java source code should be written using Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Prepare, conduct and document a test plan verifying each method is functioning properly. (Hint: Using JUNIT tests are recommended)</li>

</ol>

<strong>Deliverables: </strong>

<ol>

 <li>All Java source code used for this project. Code should adhere to the Google Java style guide.</li>

 <li>Word or PDF file demonstrating with clearly labeled screen captures and associated well-written descriptions, the success execution of your 2D graphics transformation. The document should be well-written, well-organized, include page numbers, captions for all screen captures, and a title page including your name, class, section number and date. References should be included for all sources used and formatted in APA style.</li>

</ol>
